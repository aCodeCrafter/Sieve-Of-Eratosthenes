A simple Java implementation of the Sieve Of Eratosthenes to find all the prime numbers from 1 to any arbitrary number.

When run, input a max number, and the program will attempt to find all the prime numbers up to that number, and then print them to stdout, and write them to file named "PrimesTo{n}.txt"
